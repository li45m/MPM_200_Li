Initial commit
#Summary on Hummingbird data assignment:
##Checked the structure of the data and identified that of the 12 variables, only the "brought-in-after" variable is numeric. 
##Creared a random dataset that contains 5000 observations from the original data file.
##Identified 5 risk factors affecting hummingbird survival in rescue: whether hummingbirds received first aid, location, reasons for being at the rescue, age of hummingbirds, and season.
##For each risk factor a bar plot was created, and by visual evaluation, it appears that the age of hummingbirds when they were brought to the rescue might affect their survivability.
##The portions of Selasphorus and Non-Selasphorus hummingbirds that survived were not statistically different.
